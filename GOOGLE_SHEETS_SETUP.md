# üìä Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect your survey to Google Sheets and collect responses automatically.

## üöÄ Step 1: Create a Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new blank spreadsheet
3. Name it something like "Survey Responses"
4. Keep it open - you'll need it for the next steps

## üîß Step 2: Set Up Google Apps Script

1. **Open Google Apps Script:**
   - Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name it "Survey Data Collector"

2. **Copy the Script Code:**
   - Delete the default `myFunction()` code
   - Copy all the code from `google-apps-script.js` file
   - Paste it into the Apps Script editor

3. **Save the Project:**
   - Click "Save" (üíæ icon)
   - Name it "Survey Data Collector"

## üåê Step 3: Deploy as Web App

1. **Deploy the Script:**
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
   - Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è next to "Select type"
   - Choose "Web app"

2. **Configure the Deployment:**
   - **Description:** "Survey Data Collector v1"
   - **Execute as:** "Me" (your Google account)
   - **Who has access:** "Anyone" (for now, you can restrict later)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Authorize the App:**
   - Click "Authorize access"
   - Choose your Google account
   - Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to Survey Data Collector (unsafe)"
   - Click "Allow"

4. **Copy the Web App URL:**
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz.../exec`
   - Copy this URL - you'll need it for the next step

## üîó Step 4: Connect Your Survey

1. **Update the JavaScript:**
   - Open `script.js` in your survey project
   - Find line with `const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';`
   - Replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE'` with your actual web app URL
   - Save the file

2. **Test the Connection:**
   - Open your survey in a browser
   - Fill out a test survey and submit
   - Check your Google Sheet - you should see the data appear!

## üìã Step 5: Format Your Google Sheet (Optional)

1. **Run the Setup Function:**
   - Go back to your Google Apps Script
   - In the function dropdown, select `setupSheetFormatting`
   - Click the "Run" button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
   - This will format your sheet with headers and styling

2. **Manual Formatting (Alternative):**
   - In your Google Sheet, select the header row
   - Make it bold and center-aligned
   - Add a background color
   - Freeze the first row

## üéØ What You'll See in Your Sheet

Each survey submission will create a new row with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the survey was submitted |
| Survey ID | 1, 2, or 3 (which survey) |
| Survey Title | Full survey name |
| Language | German or Japanese |
| Question 1-5 | The actual responses |

## üîí Security Notes

- **For Production:** Change "Who has access" to "Anyone with Google Account" or restrict further
- **Rate Limiting:** Google Apps Script has daily quotas, but they're generous for surveys
- **Data Backup:** Consider exporting data regularly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Script not found" Error
- Make sure you deployed the script as a web app
- Check that the URL is correct in your JavaScript

### "Authorization required" Error
- Make sure you authorized the script when deploying
- Try redeploying and re-authorizing

### Data not appearing in sheet
- Check the browser console for errors
- Make sure your Google Sheet is the active spreadsheet
- Try running the `setupSheetFormatting` function

### CORS Errors
- This is normal for local testing
- Upload your survey to a web server for production use

## üìä Sample Data Structure

Your sheet will look like this:

```
Timestamp           | Survey ID | Survey Title                    | Language | Q1        | Q2        | Q3                    | Q4                    | Q5
2024-01-15 14:30:25 | 1         | Technology Preferences Survey  | german   | Instagram | 4         | Smartphone, Laptop    | Slow internet         | Fast and reliable...

```

## üéâ You're All Set!

Once you've completed these steps:
1. Your survey will automatically send data to Google Sheets
2. Each submission creates a new row
3. Data is formatted and organized
4. You can analyze responses directly in Google Sheets
5. Export to Excel or other formats as needed
